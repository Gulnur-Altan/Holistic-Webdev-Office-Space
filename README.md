🎯 Purpose

This project was built for the Axero Intranet Challenge to explore creative and functional approaches to internal team dashboards. The goal was to build something that's not only useful — but also joyful to interact with.

🧭 What I Learned

Designing for internal tools can be just as fun and meaningful as public-facing apps.
Consistent visual language helps users navigate better.
UI/UX principles like clear hierarchy and context-aware cards make a huge difference.
